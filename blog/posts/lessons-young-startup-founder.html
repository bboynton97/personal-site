        <article>
            <p>The past six years of my career have consisted of founding two startups; completing one acquisition,
                dozens of software consulting projects and 136 undergraduate credits; and being honored with about a
                dozen awards and nominations. Yet more plentiful than any accomplishments I might have achieved are the
                countless failures and subsequent lessons I have learned throughout my career.</p>

            <p>It is often said that the path to success is through failure. That concept is absolutely true, but only
                if one is capable of reflecting on and learning from their own failures. No matter how tragic it might
                feel, there are lessons to be learned from every experience. These failures teach us more than success
                ever could.</p>

            <p>Following are lessons I have taken away from my failures that I want to share with others so they might
                be able to circumvent learning them the same way I did.</p>

            <h2>1. Your age doesn't matter as much as you think it does</h2>

            <p>One of my biggest insecurities when entering the startup scene was that I would not be taken seriously
                at only 16 years of age. I couldn't attend networking events at bars, my reasoning went; that must mean
                I couldn't be recognized as a legitimate founder. As a result, I was often less than honest about my
                age, or at the very least beat around the bush about it.</p>

            <p>Once I got to know a handful of people and got closer with a couple of mentors, I started to realize how
                silly this fear had been. Yes, there are those who will look down on you for your age. But these people
                are vastly outnumbered by those who will either treat you like any other founder or will go out of
                their way to assist you in pursuing your dreams.</p>

            <p>The fact of the matter is that being a young entrepreneur is far more of an asset than a liability.
                Embrace your age and use it to your advantage. Maintain your humility, but don't hide the fact that you
                are accomplishing feats well before your peers, because that's truly something to be proud of.</p>

            <p><strong>At the end of the day, age has very little impact on the success of a startup. It's far more
                    about what you are capable of than how young or old you are.</strong></p>

            <h2>2. Always make others feel important</h2>

            <p>When dealing with other people, whether employees, partners, friends, acquaintances or what have you,
                treat them with respect and listen. When you are passionate about your product and your business, it's
                very easy to commandeer a conversation. You work tirelessly on your business, and you want to share it
                with the world — but unfortunately for you, most people aren't nearly as interested as you want them to
                be.</p>

            <p>Listen to others. Offer your elevator pitch, tell them what you do and then shut up. If they are
                genuinely interested, they might ask questions, and that's fantastic. But make sure you ask questions
                about them, too. Find out what they are passionate about. Ask them about their work. Ask them questions
                and make them feel important.</p>

            <p><strong>Trying to impress others is a poor way to network. By making others feel important and
                    respected, they will subsequently be much more willing to work with you, buy your product or mentor
                    you.</strong></p>

            <h2>3. Don't be blinded by your passion</h2>

            <p>When you spend eight to 12 hours a day, six to seven days a week, entirely focused on your company, it's
                very easy to see it as your holy grail and a groundbreaking product. If you're anything like me, you
                start to ignore the potential hurdles in your business plan and instead focus on the best-case
                scenario.</p>

            <p>For example, I spent a lot of time refactoring code to ensure we could handle an explosion of customers
                instead of considering how we would handle managing customers that didn't have preexisting data.
                Essentially, I was so confident in my initial idea that I failed to see the many flaws that existed. It
                wasn't until I had a mentor familiar with my industry, who was able to rip holes in my business model,
                that I could be convinced to reevaluate my plans.</p>

            <p>As an entrepreneur, when you come up with an executable idea with a lot of potential, you want it to
                work out so badly that you begin to look past the red flags. It is very important to avoid this
                blindness and identify any shortcomings or potential hurdles within your business model.</p>

            <p><strong>There will be hurdles that you will encounter, no doubt about it. What is important is that you
                    identify these obstacles early on and plan for them. Worst-case scenario: If you identify a flaw
                    that can't be overcome, it's better to pivot early on than later in the life of the
                    startup.</strong></p>

            <h2>4. Roll with the punches</h2>

            <p>Don't be afraid to pivot your startup. It's far, far easier to pivot early on than it is after putting
                time and money into your original business model or taking on investment money. This ties so closely
                with the last lesson, but is also influenced by the unnecessary stigma attached to pivoting.</p>

            <p>After I first met with one of my soon-to-be mentors, I was quickly told how poor our initial business
                model was. And you know what? He was right. But I was too afraid to pivot, and I made the mistake of
                continuing with our original business model for far too long.</p>

            <p>It would have benefited me greatly to have taken his advice, maybe verified it with another mentor, and
                considered the changes we ultimately made later anyway.</p>

            <p>I was too afraid that pivoting would make me seem inadequate. If we changed our business model, clearly
                I wasn't good enough to come up with the right business model originally. But what I hadn't yet learned
                was that <strong>coming up with ideas isn't what makes a successful entrepreneur; identifying flaws and
                    overcoming them is.</strong></p>

            <h2>5. Don't build the product before the customer</h2>

            <p>One of the biggest mistakes that I made with my most recent startup was building the product without
                enough customer input. My background is in computer science, specifically machine learning. When I
                started building our minimal viable product, or MVP, I was so confident that people would pay to use
                it. After all, we were building groundbreaking machine learning technology and putting it into an "as a
                service" system, which had never before been done. People would love it.</p>

            <p>As it turns out, our original product was nothing any business would want to use. We built a product
                that was incredibly capable, yet far too technical for most executives to understand. We had plans to
                build a more user-friendly and simplified version of our system down the road; we nicknamed it "super
                easy mode." As it turned out, that was what businesses were interested in.</p>

            <p>I knew in that moment that the past six to nine months of development had been essentially wasted. A lot
                of the behind-the-scenes code could be reused, but there was certainly a lot of lost time. Before we
                even started building a product through mockups or an MVP, we should have been actively working
                alongside potential customers in our target market to hear their thoughts and learn from them.</p>

            <p><strong>You might think that you know exactly what your customers want, but you don't. Until you receive
                    feedback from a handful of potential customers, you have to be prepared to scrap everything and
                    begin anew.</strong></p>

            <h2>6. There is no substitute for hard work</h2>

            <p>This is something we hear a lot: Harder work equates greater success. Many scoff at this idea and chalk
                up other people's successes to luck and factors out of their control. I believe that the truth lies
                somewhere in the middle. Certainly there are factors beyond our control, but there are far more factors
                within it.</p>

            <p>I truly and absolutely believe that the effort we put into something directly affects what we get out of
                it. Consider this: If you work 60 hours a week and your peers only work 40, what others will accomplish
                in three years, you will accomplish in just two.</p>

            <p>But working 60-plus hours a week takes sacrifice. You will find that successful people spend many Friday
                nights working until 3 or 4 a.m. while their friends are out enjoying themselves. They sacrifice the
                now for the future. The hope is that this sacrifice will unlock an even more enjoyable future in early
                retirement, material luxuries, a notable legacy or whatever their dreams might be.</p>

            <p><strong>We can't control our intelligence, where we are born or how we were raised. But we can control
                    our dedication, our work ethic and our willingness to work harder to pull ourselves ahead. There is
                    no substitute for that.</strong></p>

            <h2>7. Don't get caught up in your daydreaming</h2>

            <p>If you are anything like me, the thought of a successful startup exit through a lucrative acquisition or
                IPO is incredibly appealing. I think most people would agree.</p>

            <p>Again, if you are anything like me, you just might spend far too much time daydreaming about this
                best-case scenario. You might even get really into it…</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"We have 2,000,000 shares right now. I own 1,500,000 shares. Lets say we raise $1mm for 200,000
                    shares. Then we raise …. etc. etc. etc…. and we're acquired for $200 million! I would end up with
                    $30 million after dilution, taxes and expenses. What could I buy with $30 million??"</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>…Then you proceed to spend the next hour looking at listings of McLarens and Cirrus airplanes and
                mansions.</p>

            <p>Not only is this unrealistic, but it is absolutely a waste of time. I won't lie — this kind of thinking
                kept me motivated and drove me to work as long and as hard as I did. But when you spend a whole hour
                every day staring at supercars on the internet, you are at least one hour further away from seeing that
                supercar in real life.</p>

            <p><strong>Additionally, this kind of thinking twists your vision of success. It tends to become
                    materialistic and greatly affects your passion. You are no longer passionate about your product,
                    but instead about getting into that supercar.</strong></p>

            <h2>8. Catastrophic failure is not that big of a deal</h2>

            <p>After putting a lot of time — and a lot of money — into my startup, I started to fear failure more and
                more. I started to think of the company's success as life or death: "If the company fails, my dreams
                will be dead, and I'll be back at square one." I was so afraid of failure that it haunted me in my
                nightmares.</p>

            <p>Again, this was a motivator to never stop working, but it also caused far more stress and anxiety than I
                needed. It ultimately led to me feeling burned out and not enjoying the life of a startup founder as
                much as I should have.</p>

            <p>The truth is, if the company went under as a whole, I would be OK. I'd be out some cash, but the few
                years of work taught me incredibly valuable lessons. Worst-case scenario, I'd take a job somewhere else
                to stabilize financially while I considered my options.</p>

            <p><strong>Putting that much pressure on myself was a mistake. I should have spent far less time dwelling
                    on the potential for failure.</strong></p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>There are countless other lessons that I have learned from my failures in just the past few years of my
                life, but these are some of the most notable.</p>

            <p>More important than anything else stated here: <strong>Always reflect on your decisions and
                    actions.</strong> In the case of failure, ask yourself what you learned from this experience and
                how you could have done better.</p>

            <p>I am by no means an expert, nor do I draw upon decades of experience. But it is my sincerest hope that
                by sharing what I have learned through success, failure and subsequent reflection, I might be able to
                offer insight and clarity to others pursuing similar goals.</p>
