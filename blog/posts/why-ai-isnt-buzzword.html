            <p>It's no question why Artificial Intelligence became a buzzword. With promises of replacing jobs, severely
                cutting company costs and offering never-before-seen insights into data, AI seemed to be the
                one-size-fits-all solution for automating just about anything. It's too bad this wasn't entirely true…
            </p>

            <p>At least it's not true yet. To fully understand why AI has dwindled as a buzzword, it's important to
                understand the history of AI in the public eye.</p>

            <h2>The AI Winters of the past</h2>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, followed by
                    funding cuts, followed by renewed interest years or decades later. — Wikipedia</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>An AI Winter is similar to the aftermath of an economic "bubble" popping. The history of AI has been
                riddled with a cycle of hype and then finally disappointment and distrust. This typically begins with
                researchers and companies making promises of beyond 10x returns through the use of AI. They discuss the
                theoretical implications of AI in the far future and are mostly misunderstood by the general public. The
                public (including some investors and non-technical businesspeople) hype it further by over-speculating
                AI investments. This leads to a population believing that killer robots are just around the corner and
                investors believing that any company using AI is a guaranteed win.</p>

            <p>This just simply isn't the case. Eventually the AI "bubble" pops, and it hurts more than just those who
                financially invested in AI-based securities. During a Winter, AI research funding is drastically
                reduced, businesses using AI cannot grow with the promise of AI alone, and a general distrust for AI
                begins to emerge.</p>

            <p>In the end, we make some progress in the way of the technology, but little progress in public opinion.
                Unfortunately for most investors (public and private), public opinion has more influence than the
                technology- at least when it comes to first impressions.</p>

            <h2>What does this have to do with startup buzzwords?</h2>

            <p>The past five years since 2013 have seen incredible acceleration into an "AI Spring". Research, hype and
                support for AI have been at all-time highs. With the past as an indicator, this AI Spring might not last
                much longer. It can be argued that we are teetering on the edge and making our way to an AI Fall. In the
                way of venture capital, this is apparent. A few years ago, you could walk into a VC pitch with a
                half-assed business model, utter the words "AI" and walk out with a cool $40mm valuation (okay, maybe
                I'm exaggerating, but the point still stands). This is no longer the case. Why?</p>

            <p>This most recent AI Spring has been very unique from those in the past. For the first time ever, hardware
                has largely caught up with Artificial Intelligence theory. Startups with a couple hundred bucks can buy
                a GPU and effectively use technologies like neural networks in their many variations. While the
                technology was there, the AI knowledge amongst non-experts was not. Many startups and scale-ups
                struggled with AI and began to claim they were using "AI" for the sake of getting in on the hype train.
                It was such an easy thing to say and most investors didn't know how to prove the claims during their
                due-diligence phase. These companies had every intention to implement AI once they had the resources to
                hire a data scientist, but figured in the meantime they might as well advertise that they are using AI.
                I know first-hand of a few companies that did just that. You can almost hear their reasoning, "AI is a
                very broad term, so why not just throw in some linear regression and call it a day?"</p>

            <p>Eventually, the lies caught up to these companies. Many investors got burned and many founders learned a
                hard lesson in false advertising. In the end, this added to the distrust of AI and particularly the
                distrust of all startup companies claiming to use AI.</p>

            <h2>So what now?</h2>

            <p>Well, we may not be looking at another AI Winter anytime soon, but "Artificial Intelligence" is no longer
                a buzzword to most investors and businesspeople. More specifically, the height of the AI venture capital
                trend is likely over. If anything, it now causes additional skepticism and forces founders to prove
                their software's abilities beyond what would typically be expected by a VC.</p>

            <p>Companies and startups can no longer rely on, "but we use AI" to get through their funding round or to
                attract customers. This may have eliminated a possible shortcut to growth, but this is almost certainly
                a good thing. This means that only AI companies that deserve to grow will grow, helping to prevent
                over-speculation and future distrust of AI technology /companies.</p>

            <p>This transcends to a more significant change:</p>

            <p><strong>It's no longer important to ask how AI makes you look, but instead how AI makes you
                    better.</strong></p>

            <p>As the AI hype dies off, it will reveal a new expectation that every tech company uses AI in some way.
                AI, once a buzzword, will soon be a required component in startup success.</p>

            <p>Best of luck in your ventures!</p>
