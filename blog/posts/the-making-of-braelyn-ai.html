            The first time I visited Berlin, my life was in chrisis. Everything that I knew, the life I had built, was in question. I had recently come out, lost my closest friends because of it, and was on my first stop while traveling in search of finding myself truly. 
            <br/>
            I really knew nothing about Berlin previous, it was just the cheapest flight to Europe. I stepped off the plane and immediately noticed a unique culture unlike any other I had experienced in the Midwest. 
            The confidence in uniqueness that the people of Berlin demonstrated was fascinating, it was intoxicating. This was a place that I could be <i>anyone</i> I wanted to be and no one would care even a little. 
            The post-industrial gothic aesthetic... I thought, "This is it. This is my identity." The further east I went, the more I resonated with the people, the culture, the music, the grit.
            <br/>
            As many people will attest, the metaphoric center of Berlin culture is a etherial building in Kreuzberg known as Berghain. More than anywhere else, discovering Berghain changed my life. In Berghain is where I discovered myself.

            <div style="display: flex; gap: 1em; justify-content: start;">
                <img src="../assets/berghain1.JPG" alt="Berghain" style="max-width: 48%; height: auto;">
                <img src="../assets/berghain2.JPG" alt="Berghain" style="max-width: 48%; height: auto;">
            </div>

            Berghain has become a regular pilgrimage in my life. Every trip I've made offers a new perspective and a new understanding of the world.
            <br/>
            When I decided to build this site, I wanted it to be meticulously designed to reflect who I am through the language of a 3D space. The visitor of the site within seconds should be able to develop a reasonable understanding of my identity.
            It was without question that it would be a space in resemblance of Berghain.
