<h1>Learnings from AgentOps</h1>

<p>Here are some key insights I've gathered from my experience with AgentOps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Nothing matters more than PMF (Product-Market Fit)</strong> - This is the foundation of any successful product or service.</li>
  <li><strong>Conviction and attention</strong> - Having strong conviction in your vision and maintaining focused attention on what matters most.</li>
</ul>

<p>These learnings have shaped my approach to building and scaling products in the AI/ML space.</p>
